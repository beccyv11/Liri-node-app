     do-what-it-says
currently the text file is related to the spotify-this command, however if the text file were changed with a response from one of the other two commands it would run those functions.

Lastly, a log.txt file was added in order to log each command run through the terminal. 

If you would like to run this application on your own you will need your own Spotify API credentials.
